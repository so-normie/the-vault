###### Notes


﹇<br>
What is the time complexity of `std::vector<T,Allocator>::erase`?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

The time complexity is linear (i.e. $\mathcal{O}(n)$).

When container elements need to be erased based on a predicate, rather than iterating the container and calling unary `erase`, the iterator range overload is generally used with {1:[`std::remove()`/`std::remove_if()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/remove "cpp/algorithm/remove")} to minimize the number of moves of the remaining (non-removed) elements, this is the erase-remove idiom. [`std::erase_if()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/erase2 "cpp/container/vector/erase2") replaces the {1:erase-remove} idiom. (since C++20)

Given that our input is guaranteed to be in non-decreasing order, do we need an associative container (e.g., `std::map`, `std::unordered_map`, etc.) to solve this LeetCode problem?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

No, an associative container would increase the space complexity to $\mathcal{O}(n)$.

A more efficient approach would be to use two pointers or iterators: one (`i`) to iterate over the vector and another (`j`) to keep track of the position where the next unique element should be placed. This approach only requires a single pass over the vector, so it has a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Here’s how you can implement it:

```cpp
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        if(nums.size() < 2) {
            return nums.size();
        }

        int j = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if(nums[i] != nums[i-1]) {
                nums[j] = nums[i];
                j++;
            }
        }

        // Resize the vector to remove the extra elements
        nums.resize(j);

        return j;
    }
};
```

In this code, `i` is used to scan through the vector. If `nums[i]` is not equal to the previous element `nums[i-1]`, it means `nums[i]` is a unique element, so we place it at position `j` and increment `j`. After scanning all elements, we resize the vector to `j` to remove the extra elements.

This approach doesn’t require any additional space (except for the variables `i` and `j`), so it has a space complexity of O(1). It’s more efficient than the original approach because it avoids shifting elements with `erase`.

In C++, a {1:standalone function that is not a method of a class} is typically referred to as a {2:**free function**} or a {2:**non-member function**}.
^1696044454590

﹇<br>
In the context of manipulating `std::vectors`, is `erase` a **free function** (i.e., a **non-member function**), or a **member function** (i.e., a method)?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

The `erase` function can be both a standalone function and a method, depending on the context. For example, `std::erase` is a free function provided by the C++ Standard Library that removes elements from a container. 

On the other hand, `erase` can also be a member function of various container classes like `std::vector`, `std::string`, `std::list`, etc., where it removes elements from the object it’s called on.

The time complexity of `std::unique` is {1: approximately linear (i.e., $\mathcal{O}(n)$)}. Specifically, it is {1:,for nonempty ranges, exactly [`std::distance`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/distance)(first, last) - 1 applications of the corresponding predicate.}
#🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
^1696044454609

The {1:`std::unique`} function in C++ operates by eliminating all but the first element from every consecutive group of equivalent elements in the range \[first, last) and returns a past-the-end iterator for the new logical end of the range.

What does `std::unqiue` return if the container is not sorted?

#card 

The `std::unique` function in C++ operates by eliminating all but the first element from every consecutive group of equivalent elements in the range \[first, last) and returns a past-the-end iterator for the new logical end of the range.

If the container is not sorted, `std::unique` will still remove consecutive duplicate elements, but it may not remove all duplicates. This is because `std::unique` only checks adjacent pairs of elements. Non-adjacent duplicates will not be considered as part of the same group of equivalent elements and will not be removed.

Here’s an example:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1};

    auto it = std::unique(v.begin(), v.end());

    // Resize the vector to remove the extra elements
    v.resize(std::distance(v.begin(), it));

    // Print the vector
    for (int i : v) {
        std::cout << i << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this code, the input vector `v` is not sorted. After calling `std::unique`, the resulting vector is 
```cpp
{1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1}
```
, which still contains duplicates because they were not adjacent in the original vector.
