#### Solution (SQL Server)

﹇<br>
What is the _optimal_ solution to this problem? Provide analysis regarding what differentiates it to other approaches/solutions.

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

**Approach:** Simple `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, then use `ISNULL`

```sql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

SELECT
    u.user_id AS 'user_id',
    u.name AS 'name',
    SUM(ISNULL(r.distance, 0)) AS 'traveled distance' 
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN Rides r
    ON u.user_id = r.user_id
GROUP BY u.name, u.user_id
```

###### Notes

﹇<br>
What are all the possible _aggregate functions_ that can be used with `SELECT` after using `GROUP BY` in SQL Server?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

In SQL Server, you can use the following aggregate functions with the `SELECT` statement after using `GROUP BY`:

1. **AVG()**: Returns the average value of a numeric column.
2. **COUNT()**: Returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion.
3. **FIRST()**: Returns the first value of the selected column. _\*Not supported_
4. **LAST()**: Returns the last value of the selected column.  _\*Not supported_
5. **MAX()**: Returns the maximum value in a set of values.
6. **MIN()**: Returns the minimum value in a set of values.
7. **SUM()**: Returns the total sum of a numeric column.
8. **GROUPING()**: Indicates whether a specified column expression in a `GROUP BY` list is aggregated or not.

Please note that `FIRST()` and `LAST()` are not supported in SQL Server. They are available in some other SQL databases like MySQL and MS Access.

Also, remember that all columns in the `SELECT` statement that are not used with an aggregate function must be listed in the `GROUP BY` clause. Otherwise, you will get an error.

What is an alternative to `FIRST()` and `LAST()` in SQL Server?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

In SQL Server, the `FIRST()` and `LAST()` functions are not supported. However, you can achieve similar results using subqueries or window functions.

Here’s an example of how you can get the first and last values of a column using a subquery:

```sql
-- Get the first value
SELECT TOP 1 column_name
FROM table_name
ORDER BY other_column;

-- Get the last value
SELECT TOP 1 column_name
FROM table_name
ORDER BY other_column DESC;
```

In these examples, `column_name` is the name of the column for which you want to get the first or last value, `table_name` is the name of your table, and `other_column` is the column by which you want to order the data.

You can also use window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, and `NTILE()`. Here’s an example:

```sql
-- Get the first value
SELECT column_name
FROM (
    SELECT column_name, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY other_column) as row_num
    FROM table_name
) as temp_table
WHERE row_num = 1;

-- Get the last value
SELECT column_name
FROM (
    SELECT column_name, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY other_column DESC) as row_num
    FROM table_name
) as temp_table
WHERE row_num = 1;
```

In these examples, a temporary table (`temp_table`) is created with an additional column (`row_num`) that numbers each row based on the order specified in the `OVER` clause. The outer query then selects the first or last row from this temporary table. Please note that window functions are only available in SQL Server 2005 and later versions.

What are the aggregate functions that can be used with `SELECT` after using `GROUP BY` in SQL Server?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

The aggregate functions that can be used with `SELECT` after using `GROUP BY` in SQL Server are `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`, `SUM()`, and `GROUPING()`.

How do you handle `NULL` values in SQL Server?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

In SQL Server, you can use the `ISNULL()` function to replace `NULL` with a specified replacement value. For example:

```sql
SELECT
	SUM(ISNULL(column_name, 0)) AS 'sum'
FROM table_name;
```

How do you use a `CASE` statement in SQL Server? 

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

A `CASE` statement in SQL Server has the following structure:

```sql
CASE
	WHEN condition1 THEN result1
	WHEN condition2 THEN result2
	...
	WHEN conditionN THEN resultN
	ELSE result
END;
```
