###### Notes

﹇<br>
How do comparison operators handle `NULL` values in **SQL Server**?

#card 

In SQL Server, comparison operators do not consider `NULL` values as equivalent to any value, including other `NULL`s. Any comparison between a `NULL` value and another value (or another `NULL`) using standard comparison operators (`=`, `>`, `<`, etc.) will return `NULL`, not a Boolean value.
