#card 

**Approach #1**:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* invertTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return nullptr;
        }
        TreeNode* right = invertTree(root->right);
        TreeNode* left = invertTree(root->left);
        root->left = right;
        root->right = left;
        return root;
    }
};
```

###### Notes


﹇<br>
Is it generally okay to use a recursive approach for solving binary tree problems compared to linked list problems, in terms of space complexity?

#card

Yes, it's generally more acceptable to use recursion for binary tree problems as opposed to linked lists. 
- This is because the height of a balanced binary tree is $\log_{2}(n)$, leading to a recursive stack space complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\log_{2}(n))$. Even for an unbalanced binary tree, the worst-case stack space complexity would be $\mathcal{O}(n)$, which is usually acceptable. 
- In contrast, a linked list can have $\mathcal{O}(n)$ elements all in a single “chain,” causing the recursive stack to also use $\mathcal{O}(n)$ space, often making it less efficient compared to iterative approaches for linked lists.
