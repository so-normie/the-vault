^1683701589401

What is the difference between proper (“full”) continuation and simply using static variables in C++? #card 
- First and foremost, continuation not only saves the current values of variables, but also the control flow: where in the code you are, what functions you’re inside, what will happen when you return from the current function, and so on. Continuations are used in some languages to implement advanced control structures like coroutines, generators. or asynchronous I/O.
- Static variables in C++ only capture the state of the current values of variables in the program, they don’t remember where in the function you were, or what the call stack looked like.
^1684371357147


Can static variables maintain state across function invocations? #card 
Yes,
^1684371357153

Can static variables provide the control flow manipulation that continuations do? #card 
No.
^1684371357157

Can static variables lead to issues in multi-threaded program? How so? #card 
Yes.
- Since static variables are shared between all threads, which can lead to race conditions if not handled properly. 
- Continuations, on the other hand, are typically tied to the specific execution thread or context in which they are created.
^1684371357160


Continuations, on the other hand, are typically {tied to the specific execution thread or context in which they are created}.
^1684400415121


Does Python currently support continuation? #card 
Yes, you can see continuation in action in Python using generators.
Here's a simple generator function:
```python
def simple_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3
```
This function, when called, returns a generator object. You can then use the next() function to get the next value from the generator:
```python
gen = simple_generator()
print(next(gen))  # prints: 1
print(next(gen))  # prints: 2
print(next(gen))  # prints: 3
```
In this example, the generator function simple_generator is a continuation. Each time yield is called, the function's state is saved and control is passed back to the caller. The next time next() is called on the generator, execution continues from where it left off, with all local state (like the position in the code, and the values of any local variables) restored.
^1684371357165


What are generators in Python? #card 
- Generators are types of iterable, like lists or tuples.
- They do not store their values in memory, instead they generate values on the fly.

What is **static polymorphism**? #card-reverse 
<span class="spoiler">Static polymorphism</span> is also known as <span class="spoiler">compile-time polymorphism</span>. It occurs when you have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class. This is called <span class="spoiler">**method overloading**</span>. The targeted method call is resolved at compile time.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class StaticPoly {
public:
    // function with 1 int parameter
    void func(int x) {
        cout << "Value of x is: " << x << endl;
    }
    // function with same name but 1 double parameter
    void func(double x) {
        cout << "Value of x is: " << x << endl;
    }
    // function with same name and 2 int parameters
    void func(int x, int y) {
        cout << "Value of x and y is: " << x << ", " << y << endl;
    }
};
int main() {
    StaticPoly obj1;
    // Which function is called will depend on the parameters passed
    obj1.func(7);
    obj1.func(9.132);
    obj1.func(85,64);
    return 0;
}
```
This code demonstrates static polymorphism through function overloading. The `StaticPoly` class has three functions named `func`, but each takes a different number and type of parameters. When we call `func` on an object of the `StaticPoly` class, the appropriate version of the function is called based on the arguments passed to it. This is resolved at compile-time.
^1683895678121

What is **dynamic polymorphism**? #card 
<span class="spoiler">Dynamic polymorphism</span>, also known as <span class="spoiler">runtime polymorphism</span>, is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than at compile-time. It can be achieved through <span class="spoiler">**method overriding**</span> [1](https://www.javatpoint.com/dynamic-polymorphism-in-java). The determination of the method to be called is based on the object being referred to by the reference variable [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20783266/what-is-the-difference-between-dynamic-and-static-polymorphism-in-java).
Here’s an example of dynamic polymorphism in C++ using method overriding:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() {
        cout << "Base class" << endl;
    }
};
class Derived: public Base {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "Derived class" << endl;
    }
};
int main() {
    Base* b;
    Derived d;
    b = &d;
    b->show(); // calls Derived::show()
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, we have a `Base` class with a virtual function `show` and a `Derived` class that inherits from `Base` and overrides the `show` function. In the `main` function, we create a pointer to a `Base` object and assign it the address of a `Derived` object. When we call the `show` function on the `Base` pointer, it calls the `show` function of the `Derived` class because the function is virtual and is being called through a pointer. This is resolved at runtime.
^1683896084204

What is the difference between the following instantiations?
```cpp
Base* b;
Derived d;
```
#card 
- The first line, `Base* b`, is not instantiating the class. It is merely creating a primitive pointer of that type named b that is currently not pointing to anything (i.e., `NULL`);
- In the second line, `Derived d`, we are actually instantiating the class.

- **Source**: [https://realpython.com/python-closures/](https://realpython.com/python-closures/)
^1683701589497

What is an example of closures in Python? #card 
- Closures in Python are a type of function where the function has access to a free variable. That free variable is from an outer function that has finished its execution, but the inner function still has access to it.
Here's a simple example:
```python
def outer_func(x):
    def inner_func(y):
        return x + y
    return inner_func
closure_func = outer_func(10)
print(closure_func(5))  # Output: 15
```
- In this example, `outer_func` is the outer function and `inner_func` is the inner function (or the closure). `x` is the free variable. When you call `outer_func(10)`, it returns the `inner_func` but with `x` set to `10`. You can then call that returned function with another argument, `5`, and it will remember that `x` is `10`, so `x + y` is `10 + 5`, which is `15`.
