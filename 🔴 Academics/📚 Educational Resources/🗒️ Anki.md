## 🗒️ Anki

﹇<br>
What does **burying** a card do?

#card

Doing this hides the card from review until the next day.

This is useful if you want to temporarily not see a card while reviewing but don’t want to suspend it or permanently delete it.

What does **suspending** a card do?

#card 

Doing this removes it from review until you manually unsuspend it later.

This is helpful if you don’t need to review a card anymore and want to focus on other cards you are still learning but you don’t want to delete it.

﹇<br>
As of Anki the following CSS snippet valid for styling a card in Anki v2.66?

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: Rubik;
  src: local("Rubik-BoldItalic"), url("_Rubik-BoldItalic.woff2") format("woff2");
  font-style: italic;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

#card 

No, the code will not be interpreted. The `format()` specifier is not supported.
