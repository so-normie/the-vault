## 2. Linked List

### **022. linked list find**

#### Solution (C++)

What is the **optimal solution** for the problem? 
#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- **Approach:**
	- Simply use the `head` node and iterate through the list until we reach a `nullptr`.
		- If the current node’s `val` equals the `target`, return true
	- If we reach end, then just return `false`.
- **Asymptotic Complexity:**
	- Time: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
	- Space: $\mathcal{O}(1)$

##### **Attempt #1 (2023-02-8) ⏲️00:07:00**

Hypothetically, what if the linked list was a cycle? Could we simply iterate by having a `while()` loop where the iteration continues till the current node equals `nullptr`? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
No, this would not works. It would essentially be runtime error, cause we would be looping infinitely.
- Would need some mnemonic data structure to alert us when we come across the same node again!
- Best to just use a `set` in this case.
