# Use The Index, Luke!

## CHAPTER 1 - Anatomy of an Index

In simple terms, what is an index? #card 
- An index is a distinct structure in the database that is built using the `create index` statement.
- A database index is, after all, very much like the index at the end of a book: it occupies its own space, it is highly redundant, and it refers to the actual information stored in a different place.

How does SQL Server and MySQL have a twist on the concept of index? #card 
> [!info]+ Clustered Indexes (SQL Server, MySQL/InnoDB)
>SQL Server and MySQL (using InnoDB) take a broader view of what “_index_” means. They refer to tables that consist of the index structure only as _clustered indexes_. These tables are called Index-Organized Tables (IOT) in the Oracle database.
>
>[Chapter 5, “_Clustering Data_”](https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/clustering), describes them in more detail and explains their advantages and disadvantages.

How does an database index undergoes constant change? #card 
- An SQL database cannot wait that long. It must process `insert`, `delete` and `update` statements immediately, keeping the index order without moving large amounts of data.
- The database combines two data structures to meet the challenge: a doubly linked list and a search tree. These two structures explain most of the database’s performance characteristics.

Does an index occupy its own space? #card 
Yes, but it refers to the actual information stored in a different place.
^1691019758208

Is an index pure redundancy? #card 
Yes.
^1691019758212

Does creating an index change the table data? #card 
No.
^1691019758217

The database combines two data structures to meet the challenge: a {doubly linked list} and a {search tree}. These two structures explain most of the database’s performance characteristics.
