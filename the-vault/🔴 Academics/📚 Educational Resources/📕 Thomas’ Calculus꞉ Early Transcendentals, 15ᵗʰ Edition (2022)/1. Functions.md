## 1. Functions

### 1.1 Functions and Their Graphs 

#### Functions; Domain and Ranges

As defined in the textbook, what is the strict definition of a **function**?

#card

A **function** $f$ from a set $D$ to a set $Y$ is a rule that assigns a single value $f(x)$ in $Y$ to each $x$ in $D$.
^1683831928249


**Natural Domain** 

#card-reverse

When we define a function $y$ with a formula $y = f(x)$ and the domain is not stated explicitly or restricted by context, the domain is assumed to be the largest set of real $x$-values for which the formula gives real $y$-values.
^1683831928260


What is the **domain**? How is it sometimes denoted?

#card-reverse 

- The set $D$ of all possible input values of the function.
- The domain of *f* will sometimes be denoted by $D(f)$
^1683831928266


What is the **range**? How is it sometimes denoted?

#card-reverse 

- The set $Y$ of all possible output values $f(x)$ as $x$ varies throughout $D$.
- The domain of *f* will sometimes be denoted by $D(f)$
^1683831928272


When we define a function $f$ with a formula $y=f(x)$ and the domain is not stated explicitly or restricted by context, what is the domain assumed to be? 

#card-reverse 

The domain is assumed to be the largest set of real $x$-values for which the formula gives real $y$-values.
	- This is called the **natural domain**.
^1683831928277


If we want to restrict the domain of a function, to, say, positive values of x, what would we write?

#card 

“$y=x,x>0$”
^1683831928283


Does changing the domain to which we apply a formula usually change the range as well? 

#card 

Yes, usually, but not always.
^1683831928289


What is set notation? How would we write $y=x,x\geq 2$ in set notation? 

#card

In set notation, the range is $\{x \mid x \geq 2\}$ or $\{y \mid y \geq 4\}$ or $[ 4 ,\infty \}$.
^1683831928294


What is the term for when the range of a function is a set of real numbers? 

#card-reverse 

**real-valued**
^1683831928299


What are two ways a function can be pictured? 

#card-reverse 

- function as a kind of a **machine**
  ![[the-vault/assets/images/thomas-calculus-early-transcendentals-15th-edition-figure-1-1.jpg|200]]
- function can be also pictured as an **arrow diagram**
  ![[the-vault/assets/images/thomas-calculus-early-transcendentals-15th-edition-figure-1-2.jpg|200]]
^1683831928304


What is the domain ($x$) and range ($y$) of the following functions?
![[the-vault/assets/images/thomas-calculus-early-transcendentals-15th-edition-geometry-example-1-question.jpg|450]] 

#card 

![[the-vault/assets/images/thomas-calculus-early-transcendentals-15th-edition-geometry-example-1-answer.jpg|450]]
^1683831928310


#### Graphs of Functions

What is the Cartesian plane? 

#card 

A cartesian plane can be defined as a **plane formed by the intersection of two coordinate axes that are perpendicular to each other**. The horizontal axis is called the x-axis and the vertical one is the y-axis. These axes intersect with each other at the origin whose location is given as (0, 0).
^1683831928316


Describe in set notation “If $f$ is a function with domain $D$, its **graph** consists of the points in the Cartesian plane whose coordinates are the input-output pairs for $f$.” 

#card 

$\{(x, f(x)) \mid x \in D\}$
^1683831928321


#### Representing a Function Numerically

How is a function represented **numerically**?

Through a table of values

What is a **scatterplot**?

A graph consisting of only the points in the table.

#### The Vertical Line Test for a Function

Can every curve in the the coordinate plane be the graph of a function?

No, a function $f$ can have only one value $f(x)$ for each $x$ in its domain, so *no vertical line* can intersect the graph of a function at more than one point.

#### Piecewise-Defined Functions

What are piecewise-defined functions? 

#card 

In mathematics, a piecewise-defined function(also called a piecewise function, a hybrid function, or definition by cases) is a **function defined by multiple sub-functions, where each sub-function applies to a different interval in the domain**.
^1683831928326


What is the **absolute value function**? 

#card 

$$
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
    x, x \geq 0 \\
    -x, x < 0 
\end{cases}
$$
^1683831928332


When often does piecewise-defined functions arise? 

#card 

When real-world data are modeled.
^1683831928337


What is the **greatest integer function**? 

#card-reverse 

Also known as the <span class="spoiler">**integer floor function**</span>, it is a function whose value at any number $x$ is the *greatest integer less than or equal to x*.
^1683831928343


How is the **greatest integer function** denoted? 

#card-reverse

$\lfloor x \rfloor$
^1683831928349


What does the graph of the **greatest integer function** look like?

What is the **least integer function**? 

#card-reverse 

Also known as the <span class="spoiler">**integer ceiling function**</span>, it is a function whose value at any number $x$ is the *smallest less than or equal to x*.
^1683831928359


How is the **least integer function** denoted? 

#card-reverse

$\lceil x \rceil$

**Card Front**: What is a function? 

#card-reverse

**Card Back:** A function is a rule that assigns to each element $x$ in a set $D$, exactly one element called $f(x)$ in a set $R$.
^1683831928377


**Card Front**: What is the domain of a function? 

#card-reverse

**Card Back**: The domain of a function is the set of all possible values of the independent variable $(x)$ for which the function is defined.
^1683831928382


**Card Front:** What is the range of a function? 

#card-reverse

**Card Back:** The range of a function is the set of all possible values of the dependent variable $(y)$ that can be obtained by evaluating the function for all possible values of the independent variable.
^1683831928388


**Card Front:** What is the vertical line test? 

#card-reverse

**Card Back:** The vertical line test is a method to determine whether a curve in the plane is the graph of a function or not. If every vertical line intersects the curve at most once, then the curve is the graph of a function.
^1683831928394


**Card Front:** What is a one-to-one function? 

#card-reverse

**Card Back:** A function $f$ is said to be one-to-one if no two different elements in the domain of f are assigned the same image by $f$.
^1683831928401


**Card Front:** What is an inverse function? 

#card-reverse

**Card Back:** An inverse function is a function that “undoes” the action of another function. That is, if $f$ is a function, then its inverse function $f^-1$ undoes the action of $f$.
^1683831928406


**Card Front:** What is the horizontal line test? 

#card-reverse

**Card Back:** The horizontal line test is a method to determine whether a function is one-to-one. If every horizontal line intersects the graph of the function at most once, then the function is one-to-one.
^1683831928412


**Card Front:** What is a piecewise-defined function?

#card-reverse

**Card Back:** A piecewise-defined function is a function that is defined by different rules or formulas on different parts of its domain.
^1683831928417


**Card Front:** What is a even function?

#card-reverse

**Card Back:** A function $f$ is said to be even if $f(-x)$ = $f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.
^1683831928422


**Card Front:** What is an odd function? 

#card-reverse

**Card Back:** A function $f$ is said to be odd if $f(-x)$ = $-f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.
^1683831928428


#### Increasing and Decreasing Functions

What is an *increasing* function? 

#card-reverse 

If the graph of a function climbs or rises as you move from left to right.
^1683831928433


What is an *decreasing* function? 

#card-reverse 

If the graph of a function descends or falls as you move from left to right.
^1683831928438


What is the formal definition of increasing and decreasing functions? 

#card 

![[the-vault/assets/images/thomas-calculus-early-transcendentals-15th-edition-increasing-and-decreasing-functions-definitions.jpg|550]]
- Because we use the inequality $<$ to compare the function values, instead of $\leq$, it is sometimes said that $f$ is <span class="spoiler">*strictly* increasing or decreasing on *I*</span>.
- The interval *I* may be <span class="spoiler">finite</span> (also called <span class="spoiler">bounded</span>) or <span class="spoiler">infinite</span> (<span class="spoiler">unbounded</span>).
^1683831928445


#### Even Functions and Odd Functions: Symmetry

What are the special symmetry properties of *even* and *odd* functions? 

#card 

![[the-vault/assets/images/thomas-calculus-early-transcendentals-15th-edition-even-functions-and-odd-functions-symmetry-definitions.jpg|500]]
^1683831928451


Where do the names *even* and *odd* come from? 

#card 

- The names *even* and *odd* come from powers of $x$.
	- If $y$ is an even power of x, as in $y=x$ or $y=x$, it is an even function of $x$ because $(-x) = (-x)$ and $(-x) = x$.
	- If $y$ is an odd power of $x$, as in $y=x$ or $y=x$, it is an odd function of $x$ because $(-x)$ and $(-x) = -x$.
^1683831928456


What type of function is **symmetric about the y-axis**? 

#card 

even functions
- A reflection across the $y$-axis leaves the graph unchanged.
^1683831928462


What type of function is **symmetric about the origin**? 

#card 

odd functions
- A graph is symmetric about the origin if a rotation of $180^\circ$ about the origin leaves the graph unchanged.
^1683831928468


What do each of the definitions of “even functions and odd functions: symmetry” require? 

#card-reverse 

That both $x$ and$-x$ be in the domain of $f$.
^1683831928474


#### Common Functions

#### Exercises 1.1

Functions

In Exercises 1-6, find the domain and range of each function.

1. $f(x)=1+x$ 

#card 
	
   - To solve this, first, let us find the domain of $x$. To help us, let us graph the function…
   - <details>
     <summary><b>Desmos Graph</b></summary>
     <iframe src="https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/b171c3c2-c2cc-435f-b45a-7a8b39a48efc?_embed=iframe"width="600"height="800"></iframe></details>
   - As evident by the given function and the above graph, the formula $f(x)=1+x$ gives a real value $y$-value for any real number $x$, so the domain is $(-\infty,\infty)$.
   - Now, let us find the range of the function by finding the domain of the inverse function…
   - $$
     \begin{aligned}
     f(x) &= 1 + x \\ 
     f(x) - 1 &= x \\
     x &= \sqrt{f(x) - 1}
     \end{aligned}
     $$
   - Switching $f(x)$ with $x$, and vice versa, we get the following equation and graph.
   - $$
     \boxed{
     \begin{aligned} 
     2x + y &= 10 \\ 
     3x - 2y &= 4 
     \end{aligned} 
     } 
     $$
