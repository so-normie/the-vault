[In MSYS2, you can list all the installed packages by using the `pacman` command](https://www.msys2.org/docs/package-management/)[1](https://www.msys2.org/docs/package-management/)[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60484288/msys2-included-packages)[3](https://www.msys2.org/wiki/MSYS2-reinstallation/). 

Here is the command:

```bash
pacman -Q
```
