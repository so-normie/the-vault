## Preface

Hence, the goal of this book is to provide the reader with the core knowledge of {1:distributed} and {1:concurrent} systems. [📑](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/foundations-of-scalable/9781098106058/preface01.html#:-:text=Hence%2C%20the%20goal%20of%20this%20b,d%20and%20concurrent%20systems.)

It also introduces a collection of {1:software architecture approaches} and distributed technologies that can be used to build scalable systems. [📑](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/foundations-of-scalable/9781098106058/preface01.html#:-:text=software%20architecture%20app,roaches)

### Why Scalability?

﹇<br>
What is the definition of the word  _veritable_? [📑](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/foundations-of-scalable/9781098106058/preface01.html#:-:text=veritable)

#card 

The word “veritable” is an adjective. [It is often used as an intensifier to qualify a metaphor](about:blank#)[1](https://bing.com/search?q=Merriam+webster+definition+of+veritable). 

According to Merriam-Webster, it means being in fact the thing named and not false, unreal, or imaginary. 

[It is often used to stress the aptness of a metaphor](about:blank#)[2](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/veritable). 
- [For example, one could say “a veritable mountain of references” to emphasize the large amount of references](about:blank#)[2](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/veritable). 

[The word “veritable” came to English through Anglo-French from Latin and is ultimately derived from “verus”, the Latin word for “true”, which also gave us verify, aver, and verdict](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/veritable)[2](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/veritable).

We all know of systems that fail suddenly when exposed to {1:unexpected high loads}—such situations are (in the best cases) bad publicity for organizations, and at worst can result in lost jobs or destroyed companies.

How is software unlike physical systems? [📑](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/foundations-of-scalable/9781098106058/preface01.html#:-:text=Software%20is%20unlike%20physic,ms%20in%20that%20it%E2%80%99s%20amorphous)

#card 

Software is unlike physical systems in that it’s amorphous—its physical form ($1$s and $0$s) bears no resemblance to its actual capabilities. We’d never expect to transform a small village of $500$ people into a city of $10$ million overnight. But we sometimes expect our software systems to suddenly handle one thousand times the number of requests they were designed for. Unsurprisingly, the outcomes are rarely pretty.

### Who This Book Is For

﹇<br>
Who is the major target audience for this book? [](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/foundations-of-scalable/9781098106058/preface01.html#:-:text=major%20target%20audience)

#card 

The major target audience for this book is software engineers and architects who have zero or limited experience with distributed, concurrent systems. 
- They need to deepen both their theoretical and practical design knowledge in order to meet the challenges of building larger-scale, typically internet-facing applications.

### What You Will Learn

﹇<br>
In the _broad_ context of software engineering, what does concurrency mean?

#card 

In software engineering, concurrency refers to the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the final outcome<sup>[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_%28computer_science%29)</sup>. This allows for parallel execution of the concurrent units, which can significantly improve overall speed of the execution in multi-processor and multi-core systems<sup>[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_%28computer_science%29)</sup>.



[Concurrent programming involves dealing with constructs such as threads and locks and avoiding issues like race conditions and deadlocks](https://www.toptal.com/software/introduction-to-concurrent-programming)[2](https://www.toptal.com/software/introduction-to-concurrent-programming). [Through concurrency, programs can be designed as independent processes working together in a specific composition](https://www.toptal.com/software/introduction-to-concurrent-programming)[2](https://www.toptal.com/software/introduction-to-concurrent-programming).

The concurrent model in software engineering focuses on executing multiple processes concurrently. [It aims to enhance the efficacy and performance of software systems through the use of parallel processing](https://heavycoding.com/concurrent-model-in-software-engineering/)[3](https://heavycoding.com/concurrent-model-in-software-engineering/).

﹇<br>
Is _concurrency_ the same thing as _parallelism_?

#card 

[Concurrency is not parallelism: concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once but parallelism is about doing lots of things at once](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_%28computer_science%29)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_%28computer_science%29). [Concurrency is about structure, parallelism is about execution, concurrency provides a way to structure a solution to solve a problem that may (but not necessarily) be parallelizable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_%28computer_science%29)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_%28computer_science%29).
