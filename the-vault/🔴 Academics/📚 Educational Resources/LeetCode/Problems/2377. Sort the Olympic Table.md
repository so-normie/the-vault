##### **Solution** :: Edmund Leibert III :: Attempt #1 :: “Simply use `ORDER BY` to ensure desired sorting”

```sql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT
    country AS 'country',
    gold_medals AS 'gold_medals',
    silver_medals AS 'silver_medals',
    bronze_medals AS 'bronze_medals'
FROM
    Olympic o
ORDER BY
    gold_medals DESC,
    silver_medals DESC,
    bronze_medals DESC,
    country ASC
```

###### Notes

﹇<br>
Given a table called `Olympic` with the following schema…

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| country       | varchar |
| gold_medals   | int     |
| silver_medals | int     |
| bronze_medals | int     |
+---------------+---------+
In SQL, country is the primary key for this table.
Each row in this table shows a country name and the number of gold, silver, and bronze medals it won in the Olympic games.
```

How can I create a **resulting set**, where the Olympic table is now sorted according to the following rules:
- The country with more gold medals comes first.
- If there is a tie in the gold medals, the country with more silver medals comes first.
- If there is a tie in the silver medals, the country with more bronze medals comes first.
- If there is a tie in the bronze medals, the countries with the tie are sorted in ascending order lexicographically.

In SQL Server, the optimal way is to do the following…

```sql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT
    *
FROM
    Olympic o
ORDER BY
    gold_medals DESC,
    silver_medals DESC,
    bronze_medals DESC,
    country ASC
```

﹇<br>
In SQL Server, how can you use the `SELECT` clause to select all columns?

#card 

In SQL Server, you can use the `SELECT` clause to select all columns from a table by using the asterisk (`*`) symbol. Here is an example:

```sql
SELECT 
	*
FROM 
	table_name;
```

In this SQL statement, `table_name` should be replaced with the name of the table from which you want to select all columns. The `*` symbol is used to select all columns. Please replace `table_name` with your actual table name.

﹇<br>
Is the following code valid?

```sql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT
    *
FROM
    Olympic o
ORDER BY
    gold_medals DESC,
    silver_medals DESC,
    bronze_medals DESC,
    country ASC
    
```

#card 

Yes! There are _no_ logical or syntax errors in the code.
