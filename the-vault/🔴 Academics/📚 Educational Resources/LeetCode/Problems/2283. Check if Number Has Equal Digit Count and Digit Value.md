When iterating across an `std::unordered_map`, how can I access the _first_ and _second_ element of the pair?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

In C++, when you’re iterating over an `unordered_map`, each element in the map is a `pair` where the `first` element is the key and the `second` element is the value. Here’s how you can access them:

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> my_map;

    // Populate the map
    my_map[1] = 2;
    my_map[3] = 4;
    my_map[5] = 6;

    // Iterate over the map
    for (const auto& pair : my_map) {
        int key = pair.first;
        int value = pair.second;

        // Now you can use key and value
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `pair.first` gives you the key and `pair.second` gives you the value for each element in the `unordered_map`. You can replace `int` with whatever type your `unordered_map` is using.

What library is the C++ function `atoi` a part of?

The `atoi` function in C++ is part of the `cstdlib` library<sup>[\[1\]](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/atoi/)</sup><sup>[\[2\]](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_atoi.htm)</sup><sup>[\[3\]](https://www.includehelp.com/cpp-tutorial/atoi-function-with-example.aspx)</sup><sup>[\[4\]](https://www.scaler.com/topics/cpp-atoi/)</sup><sup>[\[5\]](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/cpp-tutorial/atoi-in-cpp)</sup>.

How can one use `atoi()` with a `std::string` object?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

You technically **cannot*.

The issue with the premise is that you’re trying to use `atoi` on a `std::string` object. The `atoi` function is designed to work with C-style strings (null-terminated character arrays), not `std::string` objects.

However, `std::string` provides a member function `c_str()` that returns a pointer to a null-terminated character array representing the string’s contents, which can be used with `atoi`. Here’s how you can modify your code:

```cpp
for(const auto& elem : num_map ) {
    if(atoi(elem.first.c_str()) != elem.second) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

In this modified code, `elem.first.c_str()` converts the `std::string` to a C-style string, which can then be used with `atoi`. This should resolve the issue with your code.

If you want to explicitly convert a `char` to an `int` in C++, you can simply {1:assign the `char` to an `int`}. This will automatically {1:convert the `char` to its ASCII value, which is an integer}.

In C++, how can you convert a digit that is being represented as a `char` (i.e. `'5'`) to an `int`?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

In C++, you can convert a digit character to its corresponding integer value by subtracting the character ‘0’ from it. Here’s an example:

```cpp
char c = '5';
int i = c - '0';
```

In this code, `c - '0'` converts the digit character `c` to its corresponding integer value. So if `c` is ‘5’, `i` will be 5. This works because the ASCII values of the digit characters ‘0’ through ‘9’ are consecutive.

How can you convert a `std::string` of digit characters to an integer?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

If you want to convert a string of digit characters to an integer, you can use the `std::stoi` function or similar functions in the `<string>` library:

```cpp
std::string s = "123";
int i = std::stoi(s);
```

In this code, `std::stoi(s)` converts the string of digit characters `s` to its corresponding integer value. So if `s` is “123”, `i` will be 123.

How can you convert an `int` to its literal representation as a `char` in C++?

#card 

In C++, you can convert an integer to its corresponding character representation by adding the integer to the character ‘0’. Here’s an example:

```cpp
int i = 5;
char c = '0' + i;
```

In this code, `i` is an integer and `c` is a character. The expression `'0' + i` converts the integer `i` to its corresponding character representation. So if `i` is 5, `c` will be ‘5’. This works because the ASCII values of the digit characters ‘0’ through ‘9’ are consecutive.

What are some of the several ways to convert an `int` to a `char` in C++ using the standard library?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

These are some of the several ways to convert an integer to a character in C++ using the standard library:

1. **Using typecasting**: You can simply cast the integer to a char. This works because characters are internally represented as integers according to the ASCII table<sup>[\[1\]](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp-program-for-int-to-char-conversion/)</sup>.

```cpp
int N = 65;
char c = static_cast<char>(N);
```

2. **Using `sprintf`**: The `sprintf` function from the `cstdio` library can be used to convert an integer to a string, and then you can access the characters of that string<sup>[\[2\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10847237/how-to-convert-from-int-to-char)</sup>.

```cpp
int N = 1234;
char n_char[Max_Digits + sizeof(char)];
std::sprintf(n_char, "%d", N);
```

3. **Using `std::to_string` and `c_str`**: The `std::to_string` function converts an integer to a string, and then the `c_str` method can be used to get a C-style string (array of characters) from the `std::string`<sup>[\[1\]](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp-program-for-int-to-char-conversion/)</sup>.

```cpp
int N = 1234;
string t = std::to_string(N);
char const *n_char = t.c_str();
```

4. **Using `std::stringstream`**: A `std::stringstream` can be used to convert an integer to a string, similar to how `std::to_string` works<sup>[\[1\]](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp-program-for-int-to-char-conversion/)</sup>.

```cpp
int number = 33;
stringstream strs;
strs << number;
string temp_str = strs.str();
char const *pchar = temp_str.c_str();
```

Please note that these methods convert an integer to a string or a character according to the ASCII table, not to the literal character representation of the integer (e.g., ‘1’ for 1). If you want to convert an integer (in the range 0-9) to its corresponding digit character, you can simply add ‘0’ to it.
