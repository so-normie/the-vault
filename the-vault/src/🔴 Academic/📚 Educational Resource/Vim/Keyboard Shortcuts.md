What is the command to tab right a selection in **Vim**?

#card 

In Vim, you can tab right a selection by following these steps:

1. [Select your block of text with visual line mode by pressing `V`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1407922/how-to-tab-back-forward-a-block-of-code-in-vim)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1407922/how-to-tab-back-forward-a-block-of-code-in-vim).
2. [Press `>` to indent the text](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1407922/how-to-tab-back-forward-a-block-of-code-in-vim)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1407922/how-to-tab-back-forward-a-block-of-code-in-vim). [You can add a number before the symbol to repeat it, e.g`3>`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1407922/how-to-tab-back-forward-a-block-of-code-in-vim)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1407922/how-to-tab-back-forward-a-block-of-code-in-vim).
3. [Press `gv` to reselect your text if you want to adjust the indentation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1407922/how-to-tab-back-forward-a-block-of-code-in-vim)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1407922/how-to-tab-back-forward-a-block-of-code-in-vim).

[Please note that once you hit the `>` key, your selection is cleared so you might need to select the section again and hit `>` again](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1407922/how-to-tab-back-forward-a-block-of-code-in-vim)[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/442302/tabbing-visual-selection). [This can be a bit annoying when you are trying to indent something a few stops in and want visual feedback](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1407922/how-to-tab-back-forward-a-block-of-code-in-vim)[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/442302/tabbing-visual-selection). [But don’t worry, if you didn’t tab enough (or tabbed too much), then type `gv` to reselect your selection and try again](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1407922/how-to-tab-back-forward-a-block-of-code-in-vim)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1407922/how-to-tab-back-forward-a-block-of-code-in-vim). Good luck! 😊
