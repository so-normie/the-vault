##### [**Solution** :: LeetCode :: Editorial :: Database :: “Approach: Group By and Count Distinct”](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-unique-subjects-taught-by-each-teacher/editorial/)

###### **Intuition**

In SQL, the query to count the number of unique subjects each teacher teaches involves grouping by the `teacher_id` and then counting the distinct `subject_id`.

###### **Algorithm**

This task requires counting the number of unique subjects each teacher teaches in the university. This implies that we have to group by the teacher_id and then count the distinct subject_id.

Here is an example to help solidify the intuition behind the algorithm:

The original table `teacher`:

|teacher_id|subject_id|dept_id|
|---|---|---|
|1|2|3|
|1|2|4|
|1|3|3|
|2|1|1|
|2|2|1|
|2|3|1|
|2|4|1|

The table after grouping by `teacher_id` and counting distinct `subject_id`:

|teacher_id|cnt|
|---|---|
|1|2|
|2|4|

###### **Implementation**

```sql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT
    t.teacher_id AS 'teacher_id',
    COUNT(DISTINCT t.subject_id) AS 'cnt'
FROM
    Teacher t
GROUP BY
    t.teacher_id
```

###### Notes

﹇<br>
In SQL Server, how can I count all the _unique_ values in a column?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

To count all the unique values in a column in SQL Server, you can use the `COUNT` function in combination with the `DISTINCT` keyword. Here is an example:

```sql
SELECT 
	COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) 
FROM 
	table_name;
```

In this SQL statement, `column_name` should be replaced with the name of the column for which you want to count unique values, and `table_name` should be replaced with the name of the table where this column is located. Please replace `column_name` and `table_name` with your actual column and table names.

To count all the unique values in a column in SQL Server, you can use the {1:`COUNT`} function in combination with the {1:`DISTINCT`} keyword. #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server
