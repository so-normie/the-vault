In pandas, what is the equivalent of of SQL `WHERE` clause?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/library/pandas 

In pandas, you can use boolean indexing to achieve the equivalent of a SQL `WHERE` clause. Here’s an example:

```python
# Assuming df is your DataFrame and you want to filter rows where column 'A' is greater than 5
filtered_df = df[df['A'] > 5]
```

In this example, `df['A'] > 5` creates a boolean Series where each element is True if the corresponding value in column ‘A’ is greater than 5 and False otherwise. When this boolean Series is passed to the DataFrame `df`, it returns only those rows where the Series has True values. This is similar to the SQL `WHERE` clause.

Remember to replace ‘A’ with your column name and 5 with the condition you want to apply.

Consider the case that you are given a DataFrame `df`. How would you filter rows where column ‘A’ is greater than $5$?

In pandas, you can use boolean indexing to achieve the equivalent of a SQL WHERE clause. Here’s an example:

```python
# Assuming df is your DataFrame and you want to filter rows where column 'A' is greater than 5
filtered_df = df[df['A'] > 5]
```

In this example, `df['A'] > 5` creates a boolean Series where each element is `True` if the corresponding value in column ‘A’ is greater than $5$ and `False` otherwise. When this boolean Series is passed to the DataFrame `df`, it returns only those rows where the Series has `True` values. This is similar to the SQL `WHERE` clause.

In the following Pandas code, why do we pass the result of `df['A'] > 5'` into the DataFrame `df` again?

```python
# Assuming df is your DataFrame and you want to filter rows where column 'A' is greater than 5
filtered_df = df[df['A'] > 5]
```

Can you chain multiple conditions in **pandas** to filter your DataFrame, similar to using an `AND` or `OR` operator in a SQL `WHERE` clause?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/library/pandas 

Yes, you can chain multiple conditions in pandas to filter your DataFrame, similar to using an `AND` or `OR` operator in a SQL `WHERE` clause. Here’s how you can do it:

```python
# Assuming df is your DataFrame and you want to filter rows where column 'A' is greater than 5 and column 'B' is less than 3
filtered_df = df[(df['A'] > 5) & (df['B'] < 3)]
```

In this example, `(df['A'] > 5) & (df['B'] < 3)` creates a boolean Series where each element is `True` if the corresponding value in column ‘A’ is greater than 5 and the corresponding value in column ‘B’ is less than 3. The `&` operator performs an element-wise logical `AND` operation, so the condition is `True` only if both conditions are met.

For an `OR` operation, you can use the `|` operator:

```python
# Filter rows where column 'A' is greater than 5 or column 'B' is less than 3
filtered_df = df[(df['A'] > 5) | (df['B'] < 3)]
```

Remember to replace ‘A’ and ‘B’ with your column names and 5 and 3 with the conditions you want to apply. Also, note that when chaining conditions, you need to wrap each condition in parentheses to avoid ambiguity. This is because of the precedence rules in Python.

What is the equivalent to SQL's `ORDER BY` in **Pandas**?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/library/pandas 

In pandas, you can use the `sort_values()` function to sort your DataFrame, which is equivalent to the SQL `ORDER BY` clause. Here’s an example:

```python
# Assuming df is your DataFrame and you want to sort by column 'A' in ascending order
sorted_df = df.sort_values(by='A')

# If you want to sort by column 'A' in descending order
sorted_df = df.sort_values(by='A', ascending=False)
```

In this example, `df.sort_values(by='A')` sorts the DataFrame by column ‘A’ in ascending order (smallest to largest), and `df.sort_values(by='A', ascending=False)` sorts the DataFrame by column ‘A’ in descending order (largest to smallest).

You can also sort by multiple columns:

```python
# Sort by column 'A' in ascending order, then 'B' in descending order
sorted_df = df.sort_values(by=['A', 'B'], ascending=[True, False])
```

Remember to replace ‘A’ and ‘B’ with your column names. The `sort_values()` function returns a new DataFrame that is sorted, it does not modify the original DataFrame unless you set the `inplace` parameter to `True`.

Given a DataFrame `df`, how would you sort by column 'A' in ascending order, then 'B' in descending order?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/library/pandas 

```python
# Create a copy of df that is sorted by column 'A' in ascending order, then 'B' in descending order
sorted_df = df.sort_values(by=['A', 'B'], ascending=[True, False])
```

What is the following code doing?

sorted_df = df.sort_values(by=['A', 'B'], ascending=[True, False])
```

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/library/pandas 

Creates a copy of `df` that is sorted by column 'A' in ascending order, then 'B' in descending order, and then assigns this DataFrame to `sorted_df`.

﹇<br>
Just to clarify, does the `sort_values()` method of a DataFrame in **pandas** mutate the DataFrame itself, or does it return a copy of the DataFrame?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/library/pandas 

The `sort_values()` method in pandas does not mutate the original DataFrame by default. Instead, it returns a new DataFrame that is sorted. The original DataFrame remains unchanged.

However, if you want to sort the original DataFrame in-place (i.e., mutate the DataFrame), you can set the `inplace` parameter to `True`:

```python
df.sort_values(by='column_name', inplace=True)
```

In this case, the DataFrame `df` will be sorted and no new DataFrame will be returned. Please remember to replace ‘column_name’ with the name of your column.

Is the following code a _correct_ and _efficient_ solution to this problem?

```python
import pandas as pd

def not_boring_movies(cinema: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    filtered_df = pd[ (pd["id"] % 2 == 1) & (pd["description"] == "boring")]
    filtered_df = filtered_df.sort_values(by='rating',ascending=False)
    return filtered_df
```

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/library/pandas 

No! If you run the above code you will get an error.

This error message will say that the ‘module’ object is not subscriptable. This is because you’re trying to use `pd` (which is the pandas module) as if it were a DataFrame.

In your function `not_boring_movies`, you’re passing in a DataFrame called `cinema`. You should be using this DataFrame to filter and sort your data, not the pandas module `pd`.

Additionally, you can chain the filtering and sorting operations to make your code more concise.

Here’s how your function should look:

```python
import pandas as pd

def not_boring_movies(cinema: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
	return (movies_df[(movies_df["id"] % 2 == 1) & (movies_df["description"] != "boring")].sort_values(by='rating', ascending=False))

```

In this corrected code, I’ve replaced `pd` with `cinema` in the filtering line. This should resolve the TypeError you were seeing. Also, I noticed that you were filtering for movies where the description is “boring”, but your function name suggests you want movies that are not boring. So, I’ve changed the condition to `cinema["description"] != "boring"` to filter out the boring movies.

    (c.id IS NOT NULL) AND
    (c.description != 'boring')

```

#card 

No, there are a couple of issues with the T-SQL query:

1. In SQL, you should use `IS NOT NULL` instead of `!= NULL`. The `NULL` value is special and is not considered equal or unequal to any value, including itself. So, your condition should be `(c.id IS NOT NULL)`.

2. The condition `(c.rating != 'boring')` implies that the `rating` column is a string type. If `rating` is a numeric type, you’ll need to adjust this condition accordingly.

Here’s the corrected code:

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM 
    Cinema c
WHERE
    (c.id % 2 = 1) AND
    (c.id IS NOT NULL) AND
    (c.rating != 'boring')
ORDER BY
    c.rating DESC

In computer science, is _correctness_ the same thing as _efficiency_?

#card 

No, correctness and efficiency are not the same when it comes to programming or algorithms.

**Correctness** refers to whether a program or algorithm does what it is intended to do. A correct program or algorithm produces the expected output for any valid input. For example, a sorting algorithm is correct if it can sort a list of numbers in ascending order.

On the other hand, **efficiency** refers to how well a program or algorithm performs in terms of time and space. An efficient program or algorithm can handle large inputs within a reasonable amount of time and using a reasonable amount of memory. For example, a sorting algorithm is efficient if it can sort a large list of numbers quickly.

So, while a program or algorithm can be correct without being efficient, an efficient program or algorithm that is not correct is not very useful.

Does SQL Server have a `MOD()` keyword like MySQL?

#card 

In SQL Server, the modulus operation is performed using the `%` operator, not the `MOD()` function as in MySQL [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/modulo-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16). 

The `%` operator returns the remainder of one number divided by another [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/modulo-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16). Here’s an example of how you can use it:

```sql
SELECT 38 % 5 AS Remainder;
```

This will divide 38 by 5 and return the remainder, which is 3 [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/modulo-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16). So, while SQL Server doesn’t have a `MOD()` function like MySQL, you can achieve the same result using the `%` operator.
