Is the following code both a correct _and_ efficient solution to this problem?

```python
import pandas as pd

  
def actors_and_directors(actor_director: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
	df = actor_director.groupby(['actor_id', 'director_id'])
	df = df.filter(lambda x : x['actor_id'].count() >= 3)
	df = df[['actor_id', 'director_id']].drop_duplicates()
	return df
```

How can you remove duplicate rows from a pandas DataFrame?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/library/pandas #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/python 

You can remove duplicate rows from a pandas DataFrame using the `drop_duplicates()` method. This method returns a new DataFrame with only the unique rows. You can specify which columns to consider when identifying duplicates using the `subset` parameter .

<u>For example</u>:
```python
df = df[['actor_id', 'director_id']].drop_duplicates()
```

The above code drops all duplicates of rows in the pandas DataFrame `df` that have the same `actor_id` and `director_id` values.

In SQL, the {1:`GROUP BY`} clause {2:groups the rows based on the specified columns and then applies an aggregate function to each group}. However, in Pandas, the {2:`groupby()`} method {3:groups the rows based on the specified columns and returns a `GroupBy` object that can be used to apply various operations to each group}. The {4:`filter()`} method can be used to {5:filter out groups that do not meet certain criteria}, and the {6:`drop_duplicates()` method can be used to remove duplicate rows from the resulting DataFrame}.

In SQL Server, what is the `HAVING` clause? Give me some unique examples regarding how to use it.

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/sql 

The `HAVING` clause in SQL Server is used to filter the results of a query based on aggregate functions and groupings. It was introduced because the `WHERE` keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions. The `HAVING` clause can be used with conditions such as `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=` and `<>`, where `!=` and `<>` both mean not equal to. [@SQLHAVINGClause] [@adminSQLServerHAVING2020]

Here are some examples of how to use the `HAVING` clause:

1. <u>**Filtering Groups Based on Aggregate Functions**</u>:
	```sql
	SELECT 
		COUNT(CustomerID), 
		Country 
	FROM 
		Customers 
	GROUP BY 
		Country 
	HAVING 
		COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;
	```

    This SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country, but only includes countries with more than 5 customers. [@SQLHAVINGClause]

2. <u>**Combining with `ORDER BY`**</u>:
	```sql
	SELECT 
		COUNT(CustomerID), Country 
	FROM 
		Customers 
	GROUP BY 
		Country 
	HAVING 
		COUNT(CustomerID) > 5 
	ORDER BY 
		COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;
	```
    
    This SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country, sorted from high to low. It only includes countries with more than 5 customers. [@SQLHAVINGClause]
    
3. <u>**Filtering Based on Multiple Conditions**</u>:
	```sql
	SELECT 
		Employees.LastName, 
		COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders 
	FROM 
		Orders 
	INNER JOIN 
		Employees 
		ON 
			Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID 
	WHERE 
		LastName = 'Davolio' OR 
		LastName = 'Fuller' 
	GROUP BY 
		LastName 
	HAVING 
		COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 25;
    ```
    
    This SQL statement lists if the employees “Davolio” or “Fuller” have registered more than 25 orders.  [@SQLHAVINGClause]

﹇<br>
In SQL server, give an example of using the `HAVING` clause where we _don't_ use `COUNT`?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/sql 

You can use the `HAVING` clause with other aggregate functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` etc. Here’s an example using the `AVG` function:

```sql
SELECT 
	SalesPerson, 
	AVG(SaleAmount) as AverageSales
FROM 
	Sales
GROUP BY 
	SalesPerson
HAVING 
	AVG(SaleAmount) > 2000;
```

In this SQL statement, we’re grouping sales by each salesperson and calculating their average sales amount. The `HAVING` clause is then used to filter out any salespeople whose average sales amount is less than 2000. So, the result will only include salespeople who have an average sales amount greater than 2000.
