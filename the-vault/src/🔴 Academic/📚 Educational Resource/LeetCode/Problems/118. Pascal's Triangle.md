In brief, what is Pascal’s triangle?
#card 
In **Pascal's triangle**, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:

What is **Pascal’s law**?
#card 
In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), **Pascal's rule** (or **Pascal's formula**) is a [combinatorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics "Combinatorics") [identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(mathematics) "Identity (mathematics)") about [binomial coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient "Binomial coefficient"). It states that for positive [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number") $n$ and $k$,
$$
\binom{n-1}{k} + \binom{n-1}{k-1} = \binom{n}{k}
$$
, where $\binom{n}{k}$ is a is a binomial coefficient; one interpretation of the coefficient of the $x^k$ term in the [expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_expansion "Polynomial expansion") of $(1+x)^n$. There is no restriction on the relative sizes of $n$ and $k$,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_rule#cite_note-1) since, if $n < k$ the value of the binomial coefficient is zero and the identity remains valid.
Pascal's rule can also be viewed as a statement that the formula
$$
\frac{(x+y)!}{x!y!} = \binom{x+y}{x} = \binom{x+y}{y}
$$
solves the linear two-dimensional difference equation
$$
N_{x,y} = N_{x-1,y} + N_{x,y-1}, \quad N_{0,y-1} = N_{x,0} = 1
$$
over the natural numbers. Thus, Pascal's rule is also a statement about a formula for the numbers appearing in [Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle "Pascal's triangle").
Pascal's rule can also be generalized to apply to [multinomial coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_coefficient "Multinomial coefficient").
