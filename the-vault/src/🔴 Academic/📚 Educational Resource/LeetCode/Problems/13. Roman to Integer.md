##### ✅ **(Modified) LeetCode Solution :: “Approach 3: Right-to-Left Pass”**

###### **Intuition**

This approach is a more elegant variant of [Approach 1](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/editorial/). Just to be clear though, [_Approach 1 and Approach 2 are probably sufficient for an interview](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/editorial/). This approach is still well worth understanding though._

In the "subtraction" cases, such as `XC`, we've been updating our running `sum` as follows:

```lisp
sum += value(C) - value(X)
```

However, notice that this is mathematically equivalent to the following:

```python
sum += value(C)
sum -= value(X)
```

Utilizing this means that we can process _one_ symbol each time we go around the main loop. We still need to determine whether or not our current symbol should be added or subtracted by looking at the neighbour though.

In Approach 1, we had to be careful when inspecting the next symbol to not go over the end of the string. This check wasn't difficult to do, but it increased the code complexity a bit, and it turns out we can avoid it with this approach!

Observe the following:

1. Without looking at the next symbol, we _don't_ know whether or not the left-most symbol should be added or subtracted.
2. The right-most symbol is _always_ added. It is either by itself, or the additive part of a pair.

So, what we can do is initialize sum to be the value of the right-most (last) symbol. Then, we work _backwards_ through the string, starting from the second-to-last-symbol. We check the symbol _after_ (`i + 1`) to determine whether the current symbol should be "added" or "subtracted".

###### **Algorithm**

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int romanToInt(const std::string& s) {
        int s_sum = 0;

        // Use unordered_map for constant-time lookup
        const std::unordered_map<char, int> roman_map = {
            {'I', 1}, {'V', 5}, {'X', 10}, 
            {'L', 50}, {'C', 100}, {'D', 500}, {'M', 1000}
        };

        for (int i = s.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            int val = roman_map.at(s[i]);

            // Use a lambda to capture common condition
            auto isSpecialCase = [&](char a, char b) {
                return s[i] == a && i + 1 < s.size() && s[i+1] == b;
            };

            if (isSpecialCase('I', 'V') || isSpecialCase('I', 'X') ||
                isSpecialCase('X', 'L') || isSpecialCase('X', 'C') ||
                isSpecialCase('C', 'D') || isSpecialCase('C', 'M')) {
                s_sum -= val;
            } else {
                s_sum += val;
            }
        }

        return s_sum;
    }
};

```

###### Notes

﹇<br>
Is the following code valid?

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int romanToInt(string s) {
        int s_sum {0};

        // Create map of values
        std::map<char, int> roman_map = {
            {'I', 1},
            {'V', 5},
            {'X', 10},
            {'L', 50},
            {'C', 100},
            {'D', 500},
            {'M', 1000}
        };

        int i = s.size() - 1;
        while(i >= 0) {

            if (i != s.size() - 1) {
                if (s[i] == 'I' && (s[i-1] == 'V' || s[i-1]== 'X') ) {
                    s_sum -= roman_map[s[i]];
                }
                else if (s[i] == 'X' && (s[i-1] == 'L' || s[i-1]== 'C') ) {
                    s_sum -= roman_map[s[i]];
                }
                else if (s[i] == 'C' && (s[i-1] == 'D' || s[i-1]== 'M') ) {
                    s_sum -= roman_map[s[i]];
                }
                else {
                    s_sum += roman_map[s[i]];
                }
            }
            else {
                s_sum += roman_map[s[i]];
            }
            i--;
        }
        return s_sum;
    }
};
```

No!

Since we are going right to left, if we desire to check the _previous_ value we should instead do `s[i+1]`.

Using {1:`unordered_map`}: An {1:unordered map} usually has {1:constant-time} lookup and can be faster than {1:`std::map`} which has {1:logarithmic} lookup time. #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 
^1695217348677


Using {1:Lambda Function}: A {1:lambda function} is used to {2:consolidate the conditions that are checked multiple times}. This improves readability and maintainability. #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

Use {1:`.at()`} for Map Lookup: Using {1:`.at()`} instead of {1:`[]`} ensures an {2:exception is thrown if a key is not found}. This can be useful for debugging. #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

What does the following snippet of code do?

```cpp
// Use a lambda to capture common condition
auto isSpecialCase = [&](char a, char b) {
	return s[i] == a && i + 1 < s.size() && s[i+1] == b;
};
```

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

Is a **lambda function** that is used to check if the current `char`, and its corresponding previous `char`, satisfy a “special condition.”

```cpp
if (isSpecialCase('I', 'V') || isSpecialCase('I', 'X') ||
	isSpecialCase('X', 'L') || isSpecialCase('X', 'C') ||
	isSpecialCase('C', 'D') || isSpecialCase('C', 'M')) {
	s_sum -= val;
} else {
	s_sum += val;
}
```

Note, how we immediately leave the conditional expression if the current position is at the start (i.e. the end of our string since we are starting from right to left). This accounts for the edge case of not being allowed to check for the previous value of the last `char` since it will be an out-of-bounds error.
