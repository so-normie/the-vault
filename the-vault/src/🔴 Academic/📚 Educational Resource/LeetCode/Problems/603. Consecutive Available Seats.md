Is the following T-SQL code a valid _and_ optimal solution? 

```sql
SELECT
    c_curr_seats.seat_id AS "seat_id"
FROM
    Cinema c_curr_seats
LEFT JOIN
    Cinema c_next_seats
    ON
        c_curr_seats.seat_id = c_next_seats.seat_id - 1
WHERE
    c_curr_seats.free = 1 AND
    (c_next_seats.free = 1 OR c_next_seats.free IS NULL)

```

#card 

No. While the code is correctly joining each row of `Cinema` with the next row it is **not** considering the case where there is only seat/row in the Cinema table.

**Input**
`Cinema` =
```
| seat_id | free |
| ------- | ---- |
| 1       | 1    |
```

**Output**
```
| seat_id |
| ------- |
| 1       |
```

**Expected**
```
| seat_id |
| ------- |
```

As you can see, the above code is incorrectly marking a seat that is free by itself, i.e., its next to a nonexistent seat, as a consecutive available seat. The condition for the `WHERE` clause should explicitly be that `c_next_seats` _exists_ and is **free**.

Also, need to make sure that you are selecting `DISTINCT` rows.

Is the following T-SQL code a valid _and_ optimal solution? 

```sql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

/*
Strategy, do I a left join with itself with the ON being curr idx +1 and the seat is free
*/

SELECT DISTINCT
    c_curr_seats.seat_id AS "seat_id"
FROM
    Cinema c_curr_seats
LEFT JOIN
    Cinema c_next_seats
    ON
        ABS(c_curr_seats.seat_id - c_next_seats.seat_id) = 1
WHERE
    c_curr_seats.free = 1 AND
    c_next_seats.free = 1 
```

#card 

Yes, the code is a valid _and_ optimal solution.
