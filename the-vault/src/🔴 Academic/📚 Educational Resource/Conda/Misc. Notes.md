How can I list all conda environments?

#card 

To list all conda environments, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
conda env list
```

This command will display a list of all your conda environments. The active environment is indicated with a `*`. The columns of the output represent the name of the environment and its corresponding location on your system. If you have not created any additional environments, you will only see the base environment in the list.
