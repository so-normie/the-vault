sorting-spec: |
  //
  // A simple configuration for obsidian-custom-sort plugin
  // (https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort)
  // It causes the plugin to take over the control of the order of items in the root folder ('/') of the vault
  // It explicitly sets the sorting to ascending ('<') alphabetical ('a-z')
  // Folders and files are treated equally by the plugin (by default) so expect them intermixed
  // after enabling the custom sort plugin
  //
