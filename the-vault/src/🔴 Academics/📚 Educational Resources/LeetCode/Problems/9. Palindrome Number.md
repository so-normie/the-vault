#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

1. Approach problem by getting lower half of the `int` and then reversing it to see if it equals the front half.
	1. **Edge Cases:**
		- If input number is between 0 and 9, it is a palindrome
		- If number is of base 10 is not a palindrome.
	2. Can make a `while` loop to iterate to the first (lower half) of the number and build the lower half.

﹇<br>
Without converting to a string, in C++, how would you get the 0th or last position of a number. How about the first digit of a number?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

In C++, you can find the 0th (least significant), last (most significant), and first digits of a number without converting it to a string by using mathematical operations. Here's how to do it:

**For the 0th (least significant) digit**:
The 0th digit is just the remainder when the number is divided by 10. You can get it using the `%` operator.

```cpp
int number = 12345;
int leastSignificantDigit = number % 10;  // This will give you 5
```

**For the last (most significant) digit**:
To find the last or most significant digit, you can keep dividing the number by 10 until it becomes a single-digit number.

```cpp
int number = 12345;
while (number >= 10) {
    number /= 10;
}
// Now, number contains the most significant digit, which is 1 in this case.
```

**For the first digit after the most significant digit**:
To find the first digit after the most significant digit, you can first find the most significant digit as explained above and then use it to remove the most significant digit from the number. After that, the most significant digit of the resulting number will be the first digit after the original most significant digit.

```cpp
int number = 12345;
int originalNumber = number;
while (number >= 10) {
    number /= 10;
}

// Remove the most significant digit from the original number
int firstDigitAfterMSD = (originalNumber % static_cast<int>(pow(10, static_cast<int>(log10(originalNumber))))) / pow(10, static_cast<int>(log10(originalNumber)) - 1);
```

Here, `firstDigitAfterMSD` will contain the first digit after the most significant digit (which is 2 in this case).

What is a general function to get a number at $n$ digit from right to left?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

To retrieve the digit at the \(n\)th position from the right (0-based index), you can divide the number by $10^n$ and then take the remainder after division by 10. Here's a general function for that in C++:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>

int getDigitAtN(int number, int n) {
    if (n < 0 || n >= static_cast<int>(std::log10(number) + 1)) {
        // Return -1 if n is out of bounds
        return -1;
    }
    int divisor = std::pow(10, n);
    return (number / divisor) % 10;
}

int main() {
    int number = 12345;
    int n = 2;
    int digit = getDigitAtN(number, n);
    if (digit != -1) {
        std::cout << "The digit at position " << n << " from the right is: " << digit << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Invalid position specified." << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `getDigitAtN(12345, 2)` would return 3 because the $2^{\text{nd}}$ digit from the right in the number 12345 is 3.

}

    } else {
        std::cout << "Invalid position specified." << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Is there any downside or limitation/bounds with the following approach?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

Certainly, there are a few limitations and downsides to this approach:

Type and Size Limitations

1. **Integer Size**: The approach assumes that the input number can be stored in a standard `int`. If the number is too large (or too small if it's negative), the behavior could be undefined.
2. **Floating-Point Numbers**: This approach doesn't cover floating-point numbers; it's designed for integers.

Error Handling

3. **Negative Position**: The function returns -1 if the digit position \( n \) is out of bounds. You might want to throw an exception or provide more specific error handling, depending on your use case.
4. **Negative Numbers**: The function does not account for negative numbers. If you pass a negative number, it would technically still get a digit but might not behave as expected depending on what you want to achieve with negative numbers.

Computational Overheads

5. **Logarithmic and Exponential Operations**: The use of `std::log10` and `std::pow` introduces computational overhead, especially for very large numbers.
6. **Floating-Point Errors**: Functions like `std::log10` and `std::pow` work with floating-point numbers and may introduce tiny errors.

Readability

7. **Complexity**: For someone unfamiliar with the math behind it, this approach might be harder to understand than a string-based approach.

Corner Cases

8. **Zero and Single-Digit Numbers**: For the number 0 or any single-digit number, $\log_{10}(number)$ would be zero or negative, which could cause issues if not handled.

What does this snippet of code actually do?

```cpp
n >= static_cast<int>(std::log10(number) + 1)
```

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

The expression `n >= static_cast<int>(std::log10(number) + 1)` is used for bounds checking, specifically to check if the requested digit position \( n \) is within the range of the number's digits.

Here's the breakdown:

1. `std::log10(number)`: This returns the base-10 logarithm of the number, which essentially tells you how many digits the number has, minus 1. For example, $\log_{10}(1000) = 3, \log_{10}(999) = 2.999$, and so on.

2. `std::log10(number) + 1`: Adding 1 adjusts for the off-by-one issue arising from logarithm. This is important for numbers like 999 which have 3 digits but a logarithm value of 2.999.

3. `static_cast<int>(std::log10(number) + 1)`: This converts the float value to an integer, effectively rounding it down to the nearest integer. This gives the total number of digits in the integer part of the number.

1. `n >= static_cast<int>(std::log10(number) + 1)`: This checks if $n$ is outside the range of digits that the number actually has. If $n$ is equal to or greater than the total number of digits, the function should return an error or a specific value to indicate out-of-bounds.

For example, for the number 12345, $\log_{10}(12345) = 4.0915$. Adding 1 gives 5.0915, and casting to `int` gives 5. That means 12345 has 5 digits. If $n$ is 5 or greater, it's out of bounds for this number.

Does static casting to `int` (e.g., `static_cast<int>`) always rounds down? 

What happens if I am applying it on a negative number like -4.3534?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

No, this is wrong.

In C++, the `static_cast<int>` conversion for floating-point numbers truncates the decimal part, effectively rounding towards zero. It does not round to the nearest integer; rather, it simply discards the fractional part.

1. **Positive Numbers**: For positive floating-point numbers, this behavior is effectively the same as rounding down.
    - Example: `static_cast<int>(4.3534)` would yield `4`.
2. **Negative Numbers**: For negative floating-point numbers, rounding towards zero is effectively the same as rounding up when considering the absolute value.
    - Example: `static_cast<int>(-4.3534)` would yield `-4`.

Here, `static_cast<int>(-4.3534)` will give you `-4`, not `-5`, because it truncates towards zero.

The `std::log10()` function returns {1:`nan`} under certain conditions, one of which is when the argument passed to it is {2:zero} or {2:negative}. This is because logarithm is undefined for non-positive numbers. #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

What does the following code snippet do?

```cpp
int revertedNumber = 0;
while(x > revertedNumber) {
	revertedNumber = revertedNumber * 10 + x % 10;
	x /= 10;
}
```

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

The code snippet reverses the digits of the variable `x` and stores the reversed part in `revertedNumber`. However, it only reverses the digits until `revertedNumber` becomes greater than or equal to `x`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. `int revertedNumber = 0;`: Initializes a variable `revertedNumber` to zero, which will hold the reversed digits.
   
2. `while(x > revertedNumber)`: The loop will continue as long as `x` is greater than `revertedNumber`.

    - `revertedNumber = revertedNumber * 10 + x % 10;`: In each iteration, the last digit of `x` is added to `revertedNumber` after shifting the digits of `revertedNumber` one place to the left (multiplying by 10).
    
    - `x /= 10;`: Removes the last digit from `x`.

Here's an example with `x = 12345`:

- Iteration 1: `revertedNumber = 0 * 10 + 5 = 5`, `x = 1234`
- Iteration 2: `revertedNumber = 5 * 10 + 4 = 54`, `x = 123`
- Iteration 3: `revertedNumber = 54 * 10 + 3 = 543`, `x = 12`
- Iteration 4: `revertedNumber = 543 * 10 + 2 = 5432`, `x = 1`

The loop will break at this point because `x (1)` is not greater than `revertedNumber (5432)`.

This kind of operation is often seen in problems where you need to reverse an integer or check for palindromic integers.

﹇<br>
How do you get the length of a number that is zero or negative?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

For zero or negative numbers, you can employ a different approach. Here are some methods:

**Zero**

The number zero (`0`) has a single digit. So, its length is 1.

**Negative Numbers**

For negative numbers, you can convert them to positive by taking the absolute value and then apply the log10 method to find the length. In C++, you can use the `std::abs()` function from the `<cmath>` header to get the absolute value.

Here's a function that handles zero and negative numbers as well:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>

int getLength(int number) {
    if (number == 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    number = std::abs(number); // Convert negative numbers to positive
    return static_cast<int>(std::log10(number) + 1);
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "Length of 0: " << getLength(0) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Length of -123: " << getLength(-123) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Length of 123: " << getLength(123) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code snippet defines a function `getLength` that:
1. Returns 1 if the number is zero.
2. Takes the absolute value of negative numbers using `std::abs()`.
3. Applies the `log10 + 1` formula to calculate the length of the absolute value.

How can one “vectorize” an `int` (i.e., split up all elements/digits into a container?)

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

The most common, or efficient way is to use recursion.
```cpp
void vectorize_int(int num, std::vector<int> &numVector) {
	if(num > 9) {
		vectorize_int(num / 10, numVector);
	}
	numVector.push_back(num % 10);
}
```
The time complexity of this algorithm is…
- Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(\log_{10}$`num`$)$
- Space Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(\log_{10}$`num`$)$
