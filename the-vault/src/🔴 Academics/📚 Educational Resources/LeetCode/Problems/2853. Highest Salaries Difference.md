- **Solution for Attempt #1 :: 📆 2023-09-16 18:03**: Use the `WHERE` clause to create subqueries ⭐

```sql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

-- Grouop by engineering and get max
-- Group by markets anf get max
-- Calculate difference

SELECT
    ABS(
        (
            SELECT
                MAX(s.salary)
            FROM Salaries s
            WHERE
                s.department = 'Engineering'
        )
        -
        (
            SELECT
                MAX(s.salary)
            FROM Salaries s
            WHERE
                s.department = 'Marketing'
        )
    ) AS 'salary_difference'

So after doing this grouping, I end up with two rows in my resulting set. One row with the max salary from the marketing department and one row with the max salary from the engineering department. 

How can I modify the below code so that it returns a single row of their difference? 

```sql
SELECT 
	MAX(salary) AS 'salary' 
FROM 
	Salaries s 
GROUP BY 
	s.department
```

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

```sql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

-- Grouop by engineering and get max
-- Group by markets anf get max
-- Calculate difference

SELECT
    ABS(
        (
            SELECT
                MAX(s.salary)
            FROM Salaries s
            GROUP BY
                s.department
            HAVING
                s.department = 'Engineering'
        )
        -
        (
            SELECT
                MAX(s.salary)
            FROM Salaries s
            GROUP BY
                s.department
            HAVING
                s.department = 'Marketing'
        )
    ) AS 'salary_difference'
```

```sql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

-- Grouop by engineering and get max
-- Group by markets anf get max
-- Calculate difference

SELECT
    ABS(
        (
            SELECT
                MAX(s.salary)
            FROM Salaries s
            GROUP BY
                s.department
            HAVING
                s.department = 'Engineering'
        )
        -
        (
            SELECT
                MAX(s.salary)
            FROM Salaries s
            GROUP BY
                s.department
            HAVING
                s.department = 'Marketing'
        )
    ) AS 'salary_difference'
FROM Salaries s
```

Why does adding `Salaries s` at the end of this query return multiple rows when, without it, it correctly as intended only returns one row?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

The reason you’re getting multiple rows when you add `FROM Salaries s` at the end of your query is because this `FROM` clause is causing the database to return a separate row for each record in the `Salaries` table. The subqueries in your `SELECT` clause are being executed for each of these rows, but since they’re not correlated subqueries (i.e., they don’t reference any columns from the outer query), they return the same value for each row.

If you want your query to return only a single row, you can remove the `FROM Salaries s` at the end. Here’s how your corrected query would look:

```sql
SELECT
    ABS(
        (
            SELECT
                MAX(s.salary)
            FROM Salaries s
            WHERE
                s.department = 'Engineering'
        )
        -
        (
            SELECT
                MAX(s.salary)
            FROM Salaries s
            WHERE
                s.department = 'Marketing'
        )
    ) AS 'salary_difference'
```

This query will return the absolute difference between the maximum salaries of the ‘Engineering’ and ‘Marketing’ departments. The `WHERE` clause is used instead of `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` to filter the salaries by department before finding the maximum. This ensures that each subquery returns only a single value, which can then be subtracted to find the difference. Please replace ‘Engineering’ and ‘Marketing’ with your actual department names if they are different.

In the following code…

```sql
SELECT
    ABS(
        (
            SELECT
                MAX(s.salary)
            FROM Salaries s
            WHERE
                s.department = 'Engineering'
        )
        -
        (
            SELECT
                MAX(s.salary)
            FROM Salaries s
            WHERE
                s.department = 'Marketing'
        )
    ) AS 'salary_difference'
```

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

The `WHERE` clause filters rows before they’re grouped and aggregated. In your case, it ensures that only the salaries from a single department are considered when calculating the maximum salary.

On the other hand, the `GROUP BY` clause groups rows based on the values in a specified column (or columns) and applies aggregate functions to each group separately. If there are multiple unique values in the column you’re grouping by, then the `GROUP BY` clause will produce multiple rows of output, one for each group.

In your original query, you were grouping by `s.department`, which likely contains more than two unique values (‘Engineering’ and ‘Marketing’). As a result, your `GROUP BY` query was producing multiple rows of output, one for each department. The `HAVING` clause doesn’t change this because it filters groups after they’ve been formed, not rows before they’re grouped.

By using a `WHERE` clause instead of a `GROUP BY` clause in your subqueries, you ensure that each subquery considers only the salaries from a single department and therefore produces only a single row of output. This makes it possible to subtract the results of the two subqueries directly.
