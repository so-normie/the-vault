What is the `IFERROR` function in Excel? #card-reverse 
The <span class="spoiler">`IFERROR`</span> function in Excel is used to trap and handle errors in a formula. It returns a value you specify if a formula evaluates to an error; otherwise, it returns the result of the formula[1](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/iferror-function-c526fd07-caeb-47b8-8bb6-63f3e417f611). This allows you to manage errors without using more complicated nested `IF` statements[2](https://exceljet.net/functions/iferror-function)
