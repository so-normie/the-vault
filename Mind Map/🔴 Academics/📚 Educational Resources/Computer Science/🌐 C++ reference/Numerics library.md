### Common mathematical functions

#### ![[🤖 ChatGPT, Bing Chat, etc. Warning]]

**Flashcard 1**:
Q: What are the C++ mathematical functions for computing the smallest integer value not less than the given value? #card-reverse 
A: `std꞉꞉ceil`, `std꞉꞉ceilf`, and `std꞉꞉ceill`


**Flashcard 2**:
Q: What is the prototype of the `std꞉꞉ceil` function in C++? #card-reverse 
A: double `std꞉꞉ceil(double x) noexcept;`


**Flashcard 3**:
Q: What is the prototype of the `std꞉꞉ceilf` function in C++? #card-reverse 
A: `float std꞉꞉ceilf(float x) noexcept;`


**Flashcard 4**:
Q: What is the prototype of the `std꞉꞉ceill` function in C++? #card-reverse 
A: `long double std꞉꞉ceill(long double x) noexcept;`


**Flashcard 5**:
Q: Which header should be included to use the `std꞉꞉ceil` functions in C++? #card 
A: `#include <cmath>`


**Flashcard 6**:
Q: Which C++ function should be used when dealing with float type arguments? #card-reverse 
A: `std꞉꞉ceilf`


**Flashcard 7**:
Q: Which C++ function should be used when dealing with long double type arguments? #card-reverse 
A: `std꞉꞉ceill`


**Flashcard 8**:
Q: Which C++ function should be used when dealing with double type or default arguments? #card-reverse 
A: `std꞉꞉ceil`


**Front:** What is an exception in C++? #card-reverse 
**Back:** In C++, an <span class="spoiler">exception</span> is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program’s instructions. <span class="spoiler">Exceptions</span> provide a way to transfer control from one part of a program to another when an error or other exceptional condition occurs.


**Front:** What happens when an exception is thrown in C++? #card 
**Back:** When an exceptional condition arises, an exception is thrown. This transfers control to a special function called a handler, which is responsible for dealing with the exceptional condition. The handler can take any appropriate action, such as displaying an error message or attempting to recover from the error.


**Front:** What does the `noexcept` keyword mean in C++? #card-reverse  
**Back:** The <span class="spoiler">`noexcept`</span> keyword in C++ specifies whether a function could throw exceptions or not. It is used as part of a function’s declaration, following its parameter list, and takes the form of <span class="spoiler">`noexcept`</span> or <span class="spoiler">`noexcept(expression)`</span>. The `expression` is a constant expression that must evaluate to a boolean value.


**Front:** What happens if an exception occurs within a function declared with `noexcept`? #card 
**Back:** If an exception does occur within a function declared with `noexcept`, it will result in a call to `std꞉꞉terminate`, which by default calls <span class="spoiler">`abort`</span> to terminate the program.
