1. $f(x)=1+x$ #card 
   - Let $n$ be the number of subintervals of length $∆x$ and $x_{i}$ is a sample point in the $i$th subinterval $[x_{i-1}, x_{i}^*]$

   - Set up a vertical $x$-axis as shown, with $x=0$ at the water’s surface and $x$ increasing in the downward direction. Then the area of the $i$th rectangular strip is $2 ∆x$ and the pressure on the strip is $δx_{i}^*$ (where $δ ≈ 62.5 \frac{lb}{ft^3}$). 
   - Thus, the hydrostatic force on the strip is $δx_{i}^* \cdot 2 ∆x$ and the total hydrostatic force $≈\sum\limits_{i=1}^nδx_{i}^* \cdot 2 ∆x$.
   - So, the total force is… 
   - $$
    \begin{aligned}
     F &= 1 + x \\ 
     f(x) - 1 &= x \\
     x &= \sqrt{f(x) - 1}
     \end{aligned}
     $$
   - $$
     \begin{aligned}
     f(x) &= 1 + x \\ 
     f(x) - 1 &= x \\
     x &= \sqrt{f(x) - 1}
     \end{aligned}
     $$
   - Switching $f(x)$ with $x$, and vice versa, we get the following equation and graph.
   - $$
     \boxed{
     \begin{aligned} 
     2x + y &= 10 \\ 
     3x - 2y &= 4 
     \end{aligned} 
     } 
     $$
