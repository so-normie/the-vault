### **007. compress 👨🏽‍💻**

#### Solution (C++)

What is/are the most **optimal** solution(s) for this problem? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- **Approach #1**:
	1. Simply set an front iterator (e.g., `itF` to the current string and and have another iterator set to find the first occurrence of an element in the input string that is not the previous element.
	2. Append to the result the distance is between `itF` and `itB` and the element at `itF`
	3. Set `itF` `itB`. 
	4. Repeat the general process again.

##### **Attempt #1 (2023-22-01) ⏲️ 00:11:55**

Is the following code valid?
```cpp
auto itSubEnd = std::find_if_not(it, s.end(), [](char ch) { return ch == *it; });
```
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
No, it is not. If you wish to use a value that was declared, outside the scope of the statement in your lambda function, you ***must specify it***.
```cpp
auto itSubEnd = std::find_if_not(it, s.end(), [it](char ch) { return ch == *it; });
```

In modern C++, what is the modern way to convert an `int` to a string? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
Use the `std::string()` functions from the `<string>` library.

How many parameters does `substr()` have? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
It has 2 parameters.
- **pos** - position of the first character to include
- **count** - length of substring

In modern C++, how can you get a substring from a `std::string` when I wish to do so by using the two iterators which already point to positions in the string I wish to copy from? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
I can simply use the `std::string` constructor. For example….
```cpp
std::string s = "Hello, world!";
auto it1 = s.begin() + 7;
auto it2 = it1 + 5;
std::string subString(it1, it2);
std::cout << subString << std::endl; // Outputs "world"
```

In the following code, is `subString` a **deep** or **shallow** copy? 
```cpp
std::string s = "Hello, world!";
auto it1 = s.begin() + 7;
auto it2 = it1 + 5;
std::string subString(it1, it2);
std::cout << subString << std::endl; // Outputs "world"
```
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
It is a **deep** copy. When using the `std::string` constructor, it creates a deep copy.

##### **Attempt #2 (2023-31-07) ⏲️ 00:27:27**

Is the following valid syntax? 
```cpp
std::string result {""}
```
#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
Yes.
^1691138538102

Is the following code valid?
```cpp
result.push_back(static_cast<int>(std::distance(itF, itB)));
```
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
The code is using `push_back()` to push an `int` into a string of elements char. Should simply call `to_string` and use the `append()` function.
