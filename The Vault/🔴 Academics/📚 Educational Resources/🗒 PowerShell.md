## 🗒️ PowerShell

What happens when you create a symbolic link? 
#card 
You are creating a shortcut to an other file or directory.
^1682809184347

Does the symbolic link take up a lot of space in your hard drive? 
#card 
No, this is why it can save you space by allowing you to have multiple copies of the same file in different locations without actually taking up the space for each copy.
^1682809184353

How do you create  symbolic link in PowerShell? 
#card-reverse  
You can use the `New-Item` cmdlet with the `ItemType` `SymbolicLink` parameter.
^1682809184357

What does the following code do? `New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "Link" -Target "Target"` 
#card 
Creates a symbolic link called "Link" that points to the *file* "Target".
^1682809184360

Can you create symbolic links to *directories* with PowerShell on Windows? 
#card 
Yes. For example, to create a symbolic link called "Link" that points to the *directory* "Target", you can use the following command: `New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path "Link" -Target "Target"`
^1682809184363

What are some of the upsides of symbolic links in PowerShell? 
#card-reverse 
- If you have multiple copies of the same file in different locations, you can use <span class="spoiler">symbolic links</span> to create shortcuts to the file instead of actually copying the file to each location. This can save you a lot of space, especially if the file is large.
- If you have a lot of files in different locations, you can use <span class="spoiler">symbolic links</span> to create a central location for all of your files. This can make it easier to find the files you need and to keep track of what files you have.
^1682809184366

What are some of the downsides of symbolic links in PowerShell? 
#card-reverse 
- If you create a <span class="spoiler">symbolic link</span> and it does not work, it can be difficult to figure out why.
- When you access a <span class="spoiler">symbolic links</span>, the operating system has to first find the original file before it can access the file you are trying to access. This can add a few milliseconds to the time it takes to access a file.
^1682809184369

What is a cmdlet in PowerShell? 
#card-reverse 
- A cmdlet is a lightweight command that is used in the PowerShell environment.
- The PowerShell runtime invokes these cmdlets within the context of automation scripts that are provided at the command line.
- The PowerShell runtime also invokes them programmatically through PowerShell APIs.
- Cmdlets perform an action and typically return a Microsoft .NET object to the next command in the pipeline.
- A cmdlet is a single command that participates in the pipeline semantics of PowerShell.
- This includes binary (C#) cmdlets, advanced script functions, CDXML, and Workflows.
^1682809184372

The {PowerShell runtime} invokes these cmdlets within the context of automation scripts that are provided at the command line. 
^1683681712871 


What do cmdlets typically return? 
#card 
A Microsoft .NET object to the next pipeline.
^1683681712879

In PowerShell, what are [cmdlets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/cmdlet-overview?view=powershell-7.3#cmdlets)? 
#card-reverse 
- <span class="spoiler">Cmdlets</span> perform an action and typically return a Microsoft .NET object to the next command in the pipeline.
- A <span class="spoiler">cmdlet</span> is a single command that participates in the pipeline semantics of PowerShell. This includes…
	- <span class="spoiler">binary (C#)</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">cmdlets</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">advanced script functions</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">CDXML</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">Workflows</span>
^1682809184376

What does `$PWD` mean in PowerShell? 
#card-reverse 
- <span class="spoiler">`$PWD`</span> is an automatic variable in PowerShell that contains the full path of the current directory.
- It is a shortcut for <span class="spoiler">`Get-Location`</span>. To get the current directory, you can use either <span class="spoiler">`$PWD`</span> or <span class="spoiler">`Get-Location`</span>.
^1682809184379


How do I open the current directory in File Explorer? 
#card
```powershell
explorer.exe .
```
^1682809184383

How to test if a file or path exists in PowerShell? 
#card-reverse 
- Use the cmdlet `Test-Path`.
- **Example 1: Test a path**
```pwsh
Test-Path -Path "C:\Documents and Settings\DavidC"
True
```
This command checks whether all elements in the path exist, that is, the `C:` directory, the `Documents and Settings` directory, and the `DavidC` directory. If any are missing, the cmdlet returns `$False`. Otherwise, it returns `$True`.
^1682809184386

**Front:** How can you enforce the type of a variable in PowerShell? 
#card 
**Back:** In PowerShell, you can enforce the type of a variable by using type accelerators or by casting the value to the desired type when you assign it to the variable. For example: 
```cpp
[int] $myInt = 10
```
or 
```cpp
$myInt = [int] 10
```
^1682809184389


What are type accelerators in PowerShell? 
#card-reverse 
<span class="spoiler">Type accelerators</span> are aliases for .NET framework classes. They allow you to access specific .NET framework classes without having to explicitly type the entire class name. 
- For example, you can shorten the **AliasAttribute** class from `[System.Management.Automation.AliasAttribute]` to `[Alias]`.
^1683700976493


**Front:** What are some common types in PowerShell? 
#card 
**Back:** Some common types in PowerShell include `System.String`, `System.Int32`, `System.Boolean`, `System.DateTime`, `System.Array`, `System.Collections.ArrayList`, and `System.Collections.Hashtable`. PowerShell also has its own set of types that are specific to the language, such as `PSCustomObject`, `PSObject`, and `SwitchParameter`.
^1682809184392

**Front:** What is the definition of a symbolic link? 
#card 
**Back:**
- A <span class="spoiler">symbolic link</span>, also known as a symlink or soft link, is a special type of file that points to another file or directory.
- <span class="spoiler">Symbolic links</span> are a useful tool for managing your files. However, it is important to be aware of the downsides before you start using them.
^1682809184395

^1682809184427

How to view the full history of commands across all shells and sessions? 
#card-reverse 
- Use the <span class="spoiler">`Get-PSReadlineOption`</span> cmdlet.
	- This cmdlet has a <span class="spoiler">`HistorySavePath`</span> property that gives you the path where all of the history is saved.
	- [You can then open this path in a text editor or use the `cat` command to list the history in PowerShell](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44104043/how-can-i-see-the-command-history-across-all-powershell-sessions-in-windows-serv)
- For example…
	<span class="spoiler">
	```
	cat (Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath
	```
	</span>
^1682809322952

^1682809184446

Can you create an alias for a `cmdlet` or other command in Powershell? 
#card
- Yes, you can create an alias for a cmdlet or other command in PowerShell using the `Set-Alias` cmdlet.
	- The `Name` parameter specifies the alias’s name and the `Value` parameter specifies the cmdlet that the alias runs.
	- For example, to create an alias named `list` for the `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet, you would enter `Set-Alias -Name list -Value Get-ChildItem`<sup>[[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/set-alias?view=powershell-7.3)]</sup>.
^1682809184449

Can you assign an alias to a command with parameters in PowerShell? 
#card 
- You **cannot** assign an alias to a command with parameters using `Set-Alias` or `New-Alias`.
- Instead, you can create a function that contains the command with parameters and then assign an alias to that function.
- For example, if you wanted to create an alias named `list` for the `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet with the `-Force` parameter, you could create a function like this:
	```PowerShell
	function Get-ChildItem-Force { Get-ChildItem -Force }
	```
	Then, you could create an alias for the function using `Set-Alias` or `New-Alias`:
	```PowerShell
	Set-Alias -Name list -Value Get-ChildItem-Force
	```
^1682809184452

How to move multiple files, for instance a file named `A.txt` and `B.txt` in one command?

```
^1682809184455


**Front:** How do you pass arguments to a PowerShell script? 
#card 
**Back:** You can pass arguments to a PowerShell script by defining them using the `param` statement at the beginning of your script.
^1683584331568

**Front:** How do you define arguments in a PowerShell script? 
#card 
**Back:** You can define arguments in a PowerShell script using the `param` statement. For example: `param(＄name, ＄address = "USA", ＄age)`.
^1683584331574

**Front:** How do you call a PowerShell script with arguments? 
#card 
**Back:** You can call a PowerShell script with arguments like this: `powershell.exe -file myscript.ps1 -name "John" -address "Canada" -age 25`.
^1683584331578

**Front:** How do you define a default value for a parameter in PowerShell? 
#card 
**Back:** You can define a script `myscript.ps1` that takes in arguments for `name`, `address`, and `age` like this:
```PowerShell
param($name, $address = "USA", $age)
Write-Host "Name: $name"
Write-Host "Address: $address"
Write-Host "Age: $age"
```
Here, the variable `$address` has a default value of `"USA"`. You can then call this script with arguments like this:
```PowerShell
powershell.exe -file myscript.ps1 -name "John" -address "Canada" -age 25
```
[This will pass the values `"John"`, `"Canada"`, and `25` to the `$name`, `$address`, and `$age` variables respectively](https://www.delftstack.com/howto/powershell/pass-an-argument-to-a-powershell-script/)
^1683898509522


How can you combine a path and child-path? 
#card 
`Join-Path` is a cmdlet in PowerShell that combines a path and child-path into a single path. The provider supplies the path delimiters[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/join-path?view=powershell-7.3). For example, if you want to combine a path with a child path, you can use `Join-Path -Path "path" -ChildPath "childpath"` which will return `path\childpath`[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/join-path?view=powershell-7.3)
^1683898614447


What is the target of a symbolic link? 
#card 
A symbolic link is a file whose purpose is to point to another file or directory (called the “target”) by specifying a path thereto. The object being pointed to is called the target.
^1683584331585

SSH stand for {Secure Shell}. 
^1683611483284 

What is SSH? 
#card 
- A network protocol that provides a secure way to access a remote computer.
- SSH encrypts all traffic between the client and the server, which protects the user's data from being intercepted.
^1683611483295

Lets say I am supposed to ssh into the account `lleibert@hills.ccsf.edu`. What would be my host? 
#card 
Your host would be `hills.ccsf.edu`.
^1683898423325


In PowerShell, to print the current host you can use the cmdlet {`Get-Host`}.
^1683898370405

What is the command to install all font type extension in Windows? 
#card 
Currently, there is not a singular cmdlet in PowerShell to install fonts. In order to install fonts in PowerShell, you need to move all the appropriate files to the  `C:\Windows\fonts\` folder.
^1684498554648

The alias for the `Get-Location` cmdlet is {pwd}
^1684687243973

What is wrong with following PowerShell command?
```powershell
Get-Command | $_.Source
```
#card 
- The problem with the command is the use of `$_` outside of a script block `{}`.
- The `$_` variable represents the current object in the pipeline, but it's only accessible within a script block.
- Here's the corrected command:
```powershell
Get-Command node | ForEach-Object { $_.Source }
```
^1684687243977

How do you find a process with task id `4200` via PowerShell? 
#card-reverse  
`netstat -ano | findstr :4200`
^1690892249692

How does one kill a process with task id `4200` via PowerShell 
#card-reverse 
`taskkill /PID 15940 /F`
^1690892249700

**Front**: What is the difference between `Get-ChildItem` and `Get-Item` in PowerShell? 
#card 
**Back**: `Get-Item` gets the item at the specified location, while `Get-ChildItem` gets the items and child items in one or more specified locations. In other words, `Get-Item` returns information about the targeted item itself, whereas `Get-ChildItem` returns information about the targeted item's children, if the given item happens to be a container ¹.

^1690892249707

What is wrong with the following PowerShell scripting code?
```pwsh
$currentDirectory = $Get-Location
```
#card 
When using the `Get-Location` cmdlet in PowerShell, it does *not* require the `$` symbol.
^1690892249714

What is the problem with the following code? 
#card 
```pwsh
Write-Host $currentDirectory > tmp.txt
```
#card 
- Write-Host sends information directly to the console, no to a file. If you want to write the value of $currentDirectory to a file, you should use either `Out-File` or `Set-Content`. For example…
	- `$currentDirectory | Out-File "tmp.txt"`
	- `Set-Content -Path "tmp.txt" -Value $currentDirectory`
^1690892249721

How can I use `Set-Content` to write the value of `$currentDirectory` to the file `tmp.txt`? 
#card-reverse 
`Set-Content -Path "tmp.txt" -Value $currentDirectory`
^1690892249727

How can I use `Out-File` to write the value of `$currentDirectory` to the file `tmp.txt` 
#card-reverse 
`$currentDirectory | Out-File "tmp.txt"`
^1690892249735

If you want to append new content to a file, you can use {`Out-File`}. If you want to replace the existing content with new content, you can use {`Set-Content`}. [You should also consider the encoding of the data when choosing which cmdlet to use](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10655788/powershell-set-content-and-out-file-what-is-the-difference). 
^1691990373869
#card
^1690892249742

By default, `Out-File` saves data to a file in what encoding? 
#card 
Unicode (UTF-16LE) *This can be specified
^1690892249751

By default, `Set-Content` defaults to what encoding? 
#card 
ASCII (US-ASCII)
^1690892249758

What is a major difference between `Set-Content` and `Out-File`? 
#card 
- `Out-File` allows you append new content to a file using the `-Append` parameter
- `Set-Content` will replace existing content with new content
 
What is the difference between `Write-Host` and `Write-Information`? 
#card 
- `Write-Host` sends information directly to the console. As such, you can *not* pipe/transfer the output of Write-Host
- The output of `Write-Information` can be redirected using either the `>` redirection operator or using cmdlets such as `Out-File`
^1690892249765

Can you use `Out-File` or `>` to redirect the output of `Write-Host`? 
#card 
No!
^1690892249772

Can you use `Out-File` or `>` to redirect the output of `Write-Information`? 
#card 
Yes!
^1690892249779

Starting in PowerShell 5.0, is `Write-Host` a wrapper for `Write-Information`? 
#card 
Yes, although only explicitly calling the cmdlet `Write-Information` can you the output be redirected or reused.

^1690892249793


What command should I run if I want to get a list of all files in the current folder, and all subsequent subfolders, that contain the word “quartz” in their name? 
#card 
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Filter "*quartz*" -Recurse -Name
```
^1690892249800

What does the following PowerShell command do?
```powershell
$Env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User")
```
#card 
[This command retrieves the `Path` environment variable for both the `Machine` and `User` scopes, concatenates them with a semicolon separator, and assigns the result to the `$Env:Path` variable in the current PowerShell session](https://shellgeek.com/powershell-refresh-environment-variables/)[1](https://shellgeek.com/powershell-refresh-environment-variables/). This will update the `Path` environment variable in the current session without needing to restart PowerShell.
